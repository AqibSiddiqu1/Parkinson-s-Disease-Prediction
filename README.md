**Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with Python and Support Vector Machine Algorithm**

This project aims to develop a Parkinson's disease prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in Python. The model uses various machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, to develop an accurate and reliable prediction model for identifying individuals at risk of developing Parkinson's disease.

**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the following Python packages:

1) NumPy
2) Pandas
3) Scikit-learn

**Data**

The dataset used in this project is the Parkinson's Disease Classification dataset, which contains various features related to voice recordings, such as jitter, shimmer, and various other acoustic measures, and the target variable is a binary indicator of whether or not the individual has Parkinson's disease.

The dataset is included in the project repository as a CSV file named parkinsons.csv.

**Usage**

To run the project, open the parkinsons_prediction.ipynb Jupyter notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.

**Results**

The final SVM model achieved an accuracy of 89.74 % on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting Parkinson's disease in individuals at risk.

**Contributing**

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please create an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request.
